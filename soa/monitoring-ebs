Volume types:
-General purpose(ssd)-gp2
 -system boot volumes,virtual desktops,low tatency apps,dev and test env
-provisioned iops(ssd)-io1
 -apps that require sustained iops(>10000iops or 160MiB/s) large database workloads 
-throughput optimised(HDD)-st1
 -straming work loads(consistent throughput at low price) big data, dataware housing, log processing
 -cannot be a boot volume
-cold(HDD)-sc1
 -throughput oriented large storage infreq accessed data
 -cannot be a boot volume
 
 Tips:
 - all boot volumes must be ssd
 - general purpose iops caped to 3000 iops 
 
 IOPS & Volumes
 -general purpose ssd volumes have a base of 3 IOPS per/GB of volume size
  -max volume size of 16,384GB
  -max iops 10000 
 EG:
 100GB volume
  -get 3iops per gb = 3x100=300iops
   - we can burst performance on this volume up to 3000 iops
      -using io credits
      -the burst would be 2700 iops(3000-300)
      
 I/O credits
 -when volume requires more than given i/o performance it uses i/o credits in credits balance up to maximum of 3000iops
  -each volume receives an initial i/o of 5400000 i/o credits.
  -can sustain for 30 min @ 3000iops
  -when u r not bursting you will be earning credits
  
  Pre-Warming EBS volumes
  -new ebs cen get max performance at the moment they are avail not require init(ie pre warming)
  -if volume restored from snashot we get i/o latency because it must read all blocks
  -to avoid this performance hit, youn should read all blocks that have data before using volume(pre-warming)
 
 EBS cloud watch metrics
 -Volume{Read|write}{Byte|ops}, VolumeTotal{Read|Write}Time,VolumeIdleTime,VolumeQueuelength,VolumeThroughput percentage,VolumeConsumedReadWrite ops
 Status checks:
 - ok,warning(degarded,severly degraded),impaired(stalled or not vaailable),insuffuciant data, 
 
 Modifying EBS volume
 - if EBS volume attached to current genertion EC2 instance type, you can increase its size, change its volume type without diattaching it
    Process:
     -issue modification command
     -monitor progress
     -after modified extend volume file system to take advantage of this increased storage capacity.
