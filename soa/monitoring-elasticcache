Important parameters
-CPU utilization
-swap usage
-evictions
-concurrent connections

-cpuutilization
 -Memcached
  -multi-threaded
  -can handle loads upto 90%, if it exceeds add more nodes to cluster
  -should be 0 most of the time and should not exceed 50MB
  -if it exceed 50MB - then increase memcached_connections_overhead paramater
  -memcached_connections_overhead determines amt of memory to be reserved for memcached connections and other miscellaneous overhead
 -Redis
  -not multithreaded. to determine the point in which to scale take 90 and divide by the no of cores
  -no swapusage, intead use reserved memory
  
 Evictions
 -eviction occurs when a new item is added adn an old item must be removed due to lack of free space in system
 -Memcached
  -there is no recomended setting, chose a threshold based off your application
  -Either scale up(increase in memory)
  -ScaleOut(add more nodes)
 -Redis
  -scaleup(more memory in primary and replicas)
  
  Concurrent connections
   -no recomended setting
   -if there is large spike in concurrent connectionsthis can either mean a large traffic spike or or uour app not releasing connections
   -for monitoring set an alrm on the no of concurrent connections
