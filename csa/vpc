Amazon virtual private cloud.
 -its a virtual ntwk
 -complete control(your own ip range, creation of subnets, config of routing tables, network gateways)
 -can create public subnets and private subnets
 -multiple layers of security inc security groups and network access control lists
 -can create hardware vpn  conn btw your vpc and your data center.
Note:
subnets belongs to sam avail zone,cannot span inbetween multiple availability zones
sucirity groups can span multiple acls,subnets,routing tables
1 subnet = 1 AZ
security groups are stateful , nacl are state less
when vpc created - security group,network acl, routing tables are created by default

Things we can do using vpc
 -launch instances into subnet
 -assign custom ip address ranges in each subnet
 -configure routing tables btw subnets table decides whether subnet publicily accessible or private
 -create internet gate way and attach it to our vpc - only on per vpc 
 -instance security groups
 -security control over aws resiurces
 -subnet network access control lists(ACLS acls are state less)
 
Default vpc vs custom vpc
 -user friendly -- -
 -a subnets in default vpc have a route out of internet(not default private subnet we have to create) -- 
 -each ec2 instance has both public and private ip address
 -if u delete default vpc the only way to gey it back is to contact aws
 
 VPC peering:
  -allows you to connect one vpc to another via direct network route using private ip addresss.
  -instances behave as if they were on same subnet
  -peer vpc with other aws account vpc or other vps in same account
  -start peering ie 1 central vpc peers with others - no transitive peering(cannot talk one vps via other).
  
 Default reserver CIDR in subnets
  -10.0.0.0(ntwk address),1(vpc router),2(dns server),3(future use),255(network address broad cast so not supported)
