# Simple Storage Service
provices secure durable and highly scalable object storage
object storage: videos,photos,pdf, docs (i..e flat files)
data spread across multiple devices and facilities.

# Basic
S3 object based allows to upload files
size-0 Bytes - 5TB
unlimited storage
files are stored in buckets(Folders)
S3 universally name space(names must be unique)
bucket url: https://<s3-eu-west-1>(region).amazonaws.com/<bucketname>


# Data Consistency Model
read after write consisyency for new objects (immediately read after write)
Eventual consistency for overwrite  puts and deletes (can take some time to propagate)
updates to s3 are atomic (whether get old or new data not currepted)

# key value store
object based:
key(name of object)(starting names of objects should inique name recomended )
value(data)
versionid
metadata(data about data u are storing)
subresources:
 -Access control lists
 -Torrent
 
 # S3 storage tier /classses
  - S3-99.99% availability, 99.999999999% durability. stored reduntant across multiple devices in multiple facilities designed to sustain loss of 2 facilities
  - S3-IA(Infrequently accessed) but requires rapid access when needed lower fe than S3, charged for retrieval dee
  - Reduces Redundancy storage - Designed to provide 99.99% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year
  - Glacier - Very cheap, used for archival only. It takes 3-5 hours to restore from glacier
  
 # S3 charges:
 storage
 Requests
 Storage Management Pricing
 Data transfer pricing
 
 # S3 Transfer Accceleration:
 fast easy and secure transfer of files over long distances(user->cloudfronts global ntwk->s3(optimised path)
 
 # S3 Versioning:
 Store all versions of object
 backup tool
 Once enabled versioning cannot be disabledonly suspended
 Integrates with life cycle rules
 Versioning's MFA capability multi factor authentication
 
 # S3 life cycle management
 used conjuction with versioning
 can bed applied to current and previous version
 Following actions can now be done:
  -to Standard-Infrequent Access Storage30 days after creation date
  -to Glacier 30 days after S-IA
  -permanently delete
  
  # Security
    by default all buckets are private
    you can setup acl's: Bucket policies and access control lists
    we can log requests to of S3 using another S3 buckets or another aws account
   # Encryption:
   Types:
   In transit(SSl/TLS): encrypt when date send to and fro to bucket
   At Rest:
    -Server side encryption
