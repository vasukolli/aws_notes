-volumes should be in same availability zone  for attaching to EC2 instance
# Adding volumes
 -Create volume using web console
 -ssh to instance issue lsblk to list devices
 -create a folder for mounting
 -vreate file system - mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
 -mount /dev/xvdf foldername
 
# Note
we can change volume type while creating new volume from snapshot
volumes exist on EBS
volumes are virtual hard disk
Snapshots exis on S3
Snapshots are pointin time copies of volumes and are incremental

# RAID (Recomends RAID0 or RAID10)
RAID=Reduntant Array of Independent Disks
 -RAID0-Striped, No Redundancy, Good Performance
 -RAID1-Mirrored, Redundancy
 -RAID5-Good for reads, bad for writes, AWS does not recommend ever putting RAID 5's on EBS
 -RAID10-Striped&Mirrored, Good Redundancy, Good Performance
 
# RAID Backups
Take application consistent snapshots
Process:
Stop application writing to disk
Flush caches to disk
Steps:Any of the below three
 -Freeze the file system
 -Unmount the raid array
 -Shutting down the associated EC2 instances
Then take snap shot

Note:
Snapshots does not include data held in cache

# Encrypting Root Device
 -stop ec2
 -create snapshot of root volume
 -copy snapshot to diff location , encrypt copy
 -create image from snapshot, you can find image at AMI category
 -launch instance from image
