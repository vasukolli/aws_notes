Backups:
 -Automated
  . allows to recover database to point in time in a retention period.
  . retention peroid between 1 and 35 days
  . it takes full daily snapshot and stores transaction logs.
  . can be recovered within retention period down to a second.
  . backup data is stored in s3
  . backups are taken in a defined windows.
  . during backup storage io may be suspended so elivated latency .
  . deleted if rds instance deleted
 -Database Snapshots 
  . done manually stored even after deletion of rds instance 
Restore:
 -if u restore backup then its a new rds instance.
Encryption:
 - supported by mysql,oracle,sql server, postgressql,mariadb
 - encryption is done using aws key management service
 - encryption reflects to backups,snapshots,read replicas
 - encryption of existng instance not possible.
 
Multi-AZ:
 -aloows to have exact copy of db in another availability zone.
 -synchronous replication
 -auto failover
 -disaster recovery only
 -supported by mysql,oracle,sql server, postgressql,mariadb
 
Read Replica:
 -for read heavy database work loads 
 -app can read from read replicas
 -Asynchronous replication from master
 -can have 5 read replicas
 -read replica from read replica
 -supported by mysql, postgressql,mariadb
 -must have automatic backups turned on in order to deply a read replica
 -each read replica have its owb dns end point
 -can not have read replica that have multi az
 -can create read replicas of multi-az source databases
 -read replica can be promoted to their own database this breaks replication
 -read replica in second region for mysql and mariadb not postgressql
 DynamoDb vs RDS
 -rds is not easy for scaling need bigger instance size or to add a read replica-manual intervention needed
 -dynamo db offerspush button scalling means scale automatically without any downime
