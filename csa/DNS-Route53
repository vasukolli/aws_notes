# Routing Policies
 -Simple:
   when you have a single resource that performs a given function for your domain 
 -Weighted:
   let you to split your traffic based on different weights assigned
   Eg: set 10% of traffic go to US-EAST-1 and 90% to go to EU-WEST-1
 -Latency:
  allows you to route your traffic based on lowest network latency
  usage: create a latency resource record set for EC2 or ELB in each region that hosts your website
  wen query reached it directs query to lowest latency region.
 -Failover:
   used when we want active/passive setup
   route53 will monitor health of primary site using health check which monitors health of end points
 -Geolocation:
   lets u to chose where ur tarffic will be sent based on geo location of ur users
  
Note:
ELB's doesn't have pre-defined IPv4 address you resolve them using domain name
Alias record vs CNAMe
Prefer alias over cname @reason cheaper
