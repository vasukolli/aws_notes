# AMI selections:
 -Region
 -Operating System
 -Architecture(32 bit or 64 bit)
 -Launch Permissions
 -Storage for root device volume
  -Instance store also called EPHEMERAL STORAGE
  -EBS Backed Volumes
 
 Note:
 For Instance store volume type we can add atmost 1 instance store volume before launching.
 Instance store volume cannot be encrypted
 We can also attach EBS volumes to instance store volumes
 we cannot stop EC2 instance with instance store volume we can only reboot or terminate 
 EC2 with instance store volume cannot be transfered to another host if host fails you lose ur data(less durability)
 afer reboot , there is no loss of data
 By default boot root volumes will be deleted on termination however with ebs , u can teel aws to keep root devise
 
 
 EBSvolumes: root device for an instance launched from AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot
 Instance store volumes:instance store volume created from a template stored in s3 so slow provisioning
