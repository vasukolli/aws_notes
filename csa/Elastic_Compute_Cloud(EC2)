# EC2: provides compute capacity in the cloud.
  -on demand- allow you pay a fixed rate by the hour with no commitmant
  -reserved- provide you with a capacity reservation nad offer a discount on hourly charge for an instance. 1year or 3year terms
  -spot- enable to bid price for ur instance capacity. if cost exceedes then instances automatically terminated
  -Dedicated Hosts- physical EC2 server whe can reduce costs by allowing you to use existing server bound software licenses
   can be purchased on demand hourly
  -On Demand-on demand instances without commitment or up-front payment
  
  Note:
  -if amazon EX2 terminates spot instances then you will not be charged for partial hour,
   if terminated by your self then you will be charge
  -if EC2 delete by default disks and volumes associated with EC2 deleted
  -By default EBS root volumes of default AMI's cannot be encrypted 
   -can be done by third party tools
  
  # Instance types:
    -D for density
    -I for IOPS
    -R for RAM
    -T cheap general purpose
    -M main choice for general purpose apps
    -C compute
    -G graphics
    -F FPGA (Field programmable gate array)hardware acceleration for your code
    -P graphics (think pics)
    -X Xtreme memory

  # Security Group (Virtual firewall)(State Full)
    -rule applied to security group applied immediately
    -Rules are stateful (i..e) if inboud rule allowed then automatically outbound rule also allowed irrespective of outbound security rule
    -cant block specifically deny specific port, protocol, ip instead use network access control lists
    -we can add multiple security groups
    -all inbound rule blocker by default
