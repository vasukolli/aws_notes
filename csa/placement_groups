A placement group is a logical grouping within a single availability zone. Using placement groups enables applications to participate in a low latency 10Gbps network
placement groups are recomended latency, high network throughput or both.

Recomended apps for low level network latency and high network throughput
Eg: Hadoop cluster

Note:
cant span multiple availability zones
placement group name should me unique
Only certain types of instances can be launched(compute optimized,GPUmmemory optimized,storage optimized)
aws recoment homogenious instance(identical instances) with in placement groups
cant merge placement groups
cant move existing instance, should create an amithen launch a new instance in instance group
